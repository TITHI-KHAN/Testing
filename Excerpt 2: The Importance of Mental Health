Mental health is an essential component of overall well-being, yet it is often overlooked or stigmatized. Anxiety, depression, and stress are common conditions that affect millions of people worldwide, disrupting their ability to work, study, and maintain relationships. Raising awareness about mental health is the first step in breaking the stigma and encouraging individuals to seek help.

Therapeutic practices, counseling, and mindfulness activities are effective ways to manage mental health challenges. Schools and workplaces can also play a role by fostering environments that prioritize mental well-being and provide accessible resources. Early intervention is key to preventing severe conditions and promoting a healthier, more balanced life.

For Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, barriers to mental health support include the lack of ASL-based resources and limited access to interpreters. Providing accessible tools and information in ASL can empower DHH individuals to seek help and improve their mental health outcomes.

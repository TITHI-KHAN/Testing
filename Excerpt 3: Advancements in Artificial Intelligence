Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern technology, transforming industries and enhancing daily life. From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to AI-driven medical diagnoses, this technology has demonstrated its potential to improve efficiency and accuracy. However, ethical concerns, such as data privacy and bias, must be addressed to ensure fair and responsible use of AI.

Education is one sector where AI has shown immense promise. Tools powered by AI can adapt to individual learning styles, simplify complex content, and provide real-time feedback. These innovations make learning more interactive and accessible for a wide range of users, including individuals with disabilities.

For the Deaf community, AI tools that integrate ASL video pop-ups and text simplification represent a significant step toward educational equity. By bridging accessibility gaps, these technologies create opportunities for lifelong learning and professional development.

What is American Sign Language? American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as spoken languages , with grammar that differs from English.

In the fingerspelled alphabet, each letter corresponds to a distinct handshape.

However, for a deaf child with hearing parents who have no prior experience with ASL, language may be acquired differently.

Children who are deaf and have hearing parents often learn sign language through deaf peers and become fluent.
